## About WeightsLab
WeightsLab is a powerful tool for editing and inspecting data & AI model weights, during training.

### What Problems Does It Solve?
WeightsLab addresses critical training challenges:

* Overfitting and training plateau
* Dataset insights & optimization
* Over/Under parameterization

### Key Capabilities
The granular statistics and interactive paradigm enables powerful workflows:

* Monitor granular insights on data samples and weights parameters
* Discard low quality samples by click or query
* Create slices of data and discard them during training
* Iterative pruning or growing of the architectures by click or query


## Getting Started

### Installation
Define a python environment
```bash
python -m venv weightslab_venv
./weightslab_venv/Scripts/activate
```
or install and use conda.

Clone and install the framework (CLI based interaction):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GrayboxTech/weightslab.git
cd weightslab
pip install -e .
```

Clone the UI repository (UI based interaction; cf. loom video):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:GrayboxTech/weightslab_ui.git
cd weightslab_ui
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
